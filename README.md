# Novi AMS Interview Mini Project

Congratulations on making it this far in our interview process! We're excited for what you could bring to the team and we'd like to have you show off just a little here with this mini project. Bring some creativity to it, but don't spend too long - your time is important! If it looks like it'll take you more than a couple hours, wrap up what you think is important and we'll talk it over when we look at your project together.

## ### About The Project
Our Novi AMS platform has an available external API that our integration partners use to build dynamic solutions of the members of our associations. Often they build a single sign on solution as well that allows third-party systems to offer a seamless experience to members. (If you're curious about how that all works, check out [this page on our website](https://www.noviams.com/third-party-integrations).)

Your project today will be to learn just enough about our API to make a call to pull some members and show them on a page. Our user stories internally are defined with acceptance criteria, so here's some acceptance criteria for this mini-project -

### API Details
- [Novi AMS API Reference](https://api-docs.noviams.com/)
- We'll send you a URL and API Key to one of our testing APIs along with your email about the project. If you didn't get it - please ask! 

### Acceptance Criteria
- Fork this repo as your starting point - we've setup a base solution for you to get you straight to the code.
- Show a list of member records retrieved from the Novi AMS API
- The list of records should show the following information at minimum - 
	- Name 
	- Customer Type (Company or Person)
	- Email
	- Phone or Mobile
	- Feel free to add additional info if you like
- Allow a user to filter the records by name
- Follow best practices and SOLID principles as much as possible. This project is small so some of that may be overkill, but we'd like to see how you think through code architecture, readability, expandability, etc.
- Don't spend more than a couple hours!

### Bonus Ideas
If you have time and want to bring some additional flair to the project, here's a couple ideas, but feel free to add your own interesting feature as well!
- Allow user to filter records by group membership
- Show an indicator of membership status and member since date
- Show the image of members in the list
- Add some design flair - make it look "good"

### Submitting Your Project
For submitting your project, you can either -
- Fork this to your own GitHub repo and send us the link
- Send us a Zip file containing the full solution.

We're good either way!
